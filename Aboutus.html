        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visibility of system status: </strong>The interface clearly shows the currently playing song, the artist, album artwork, playback controls, and the progress of the current track.</li>
            <li><strong>Match between system and the real world:</strong> The playback controls (play, pause, skip forward/backward) match the real world.</li>
            <li><strong>User control and freedom:</strong> The user has full control over playback with clearly buttons to play, pause and skip.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency and standards: </strong>The layout and functionality of this interface is consistent with other widely used music player apps, making it familiar and easy to use.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>There's a heuristics that not obey:</strong>
        <!-- This is an ordered list -->
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Help users recognize and recover from errors:</strong>When a music file is damaged or unplayable, the page simply greys out the song name and is not responsive when clicked on, without prompting the user as to what the music is unplayable for.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Interface recommendations</h2>
        <p>Set the alert text after clicking on a playback error or file error to help the user find out what's wrong and prompts the user on how to fix it. To achieve Help users recognize and recover from errors</p>
